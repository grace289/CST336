            <h2>Computer Virus Types:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>1. Memory Resident Virus - lives in memory after program is executed or terminated.</li>
            <li>2. Overwriting Virus - will overwrite computer system's file data which destroys the original program </li>
            <li>3. Direct Action Virus - selects one or more files to infect each time the code is executed.</li>
            <li>4. Boot Sector Virus - infects computer system by copying code to the boot sector on a hard drive. During startup, the virus is loaded into memory. Once in memory, the virus will infect any non-infected disks accessed by the system.</li>
            <li>5. Cluster Virus - modifies directory table entries to ensure the virus itself will start when any program on the computer system is started. If infected by this virus it will look like every program on your PC is infected.</li>
            <li>6. Macro Virus - written in a macro language and infects a Microsoft Word or similar applications and causes a sequence of actions to be performed automatically when the application is started or something else triggers it.</li>
            </ul>
